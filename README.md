Bring back your Twitter TL. Meaning:

* No ads
* No faved tweets from people you don't follow
* No "you may have missed these" tweets
* Sorted in real time!

And all of this inside Twitter.

The trick? We create for you a Twitter list with the people you're following. 

About
----------------
RealTL.io is a weekend project made by [@ojoven](https://twitter.com/ojoven)


Notes
----------------
Please be aware that this project would need some refactoring.
I don't like the naming of some of the Models, and functions and variables may need a name checking, too.
